# CapstoneProject-Critical-Contributors-for-Diabetes

## Executive summary
This is a Classification project aimed at identifying diabetes using 35 variables derived from demographic data and people's lifestyle survey information.


## Rationale

### Why this question is important?
My experience in the Healthcare/Pharma Industry has provided firsthand insight into metabolic syndrome's substantial effects on both patients and healthcare systems. The current approach in the industry is largely reactive, focusing on treating individual symptoms rather than preventing the condition's development. Typically, healthcare providers address specific markers like BMI and cholesterol levels through medication, neglecting to implement comprehensive programs that would offer a holistic view of a patient's health trajectory following each clinical encounter. However, there exist several well-known and straightforward factors that can be focused on not only to manage but also potentially reverse the condition.


## Research Question

### What have you tried to answer?
The dataset that I have used encompasses a range of personal attributes known to impact the occurrence of metabolic syndrome, particularly diabetes. My objective is to examine these individual factors, as well as their interrelationships, to determine which elements or combinations thereof are most influential in diabetes onset

## Data Sources

### What will be the source of your dataset used?
The data has been obtained from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/891/cdc+diabetes+health+indicators

## Methodology

### What methods or techniques were used in your Analysis?
My analysis started with a thorough exploration of the data, visualizing how individual and combined features were related to the diabetes outcome. This visualization process helped identify and remove features with little to no predictive value. Using the remaining significant features, I established initial performance benchmarks. I then applied diverse classification algorithms and fine-tuning methods to improve the model's accuracy. This systematic approach ultimately revealed the key factors most predictive of diabetes risk.

## Results

### What are your research findings?
The absence of diabetes is strongly linked to a healthy BMI and overall wellness. Although individual health indicators like elevated blood pressure and cholesterol levels, or combinations of these, can increase diabetes risk, their impact is relatively modest. However, it's important to note that each of these factors does contribute to some extent in the development of the condition.

## Next steps

### What are the next steps?
I plan to explore additional classification methods, subject to my computer's processing capabilities, with the goal of further improving the model's performance metrics
